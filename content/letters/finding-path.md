Gabby, as you step out into the world, you’ll encounter a thousand voices telling you who you should be. Some will be loud, others subtle. But the most important voice is the one inside you.

I’ve learned that the things that matter most in life aren’t titles or achievements or what’s in your bank account — they’re the people you share your life with. And one of your greatest gifts has always been your ability to find wonderful friends. I know that wherever you go, you’ll build a good life because you instinctively surround yourself with good people.

Life will have its twists and turns. Sometimes you’ll find yourself in messy or unexpected situations — and honestly, people are often what get you into them (that’s part of being human). But they’re also what gets you through. Connection, friendship, and love are what carry you forward when things feel hard.

Trust yourself. Stay curious. Be brave when you need to be. Let your kindness lead.

I’m incredibly proud to be your Dad, and I’m so excited to watch your life take shape. No matter where you are or what you’re doing, know that I’m always in your corner, cheering you on.
