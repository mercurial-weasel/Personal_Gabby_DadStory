This is such a special time in your life, Gabby.

University is full of possibilities - classes and projects and late nights, yes - but even more than that, it's full of people. There's a kind of energy around this phase of life that doesn't really come back in quite the same way. Everyone is figuring things out at once. Everyone is becoming themselves.

Make the most of it.

Say yes to experiences. Build friendships. Try things. Change your mind. Sit around doing absolutely nothing. Get drunk with your friends just because you can. Honestly - those random, unplanned moments often end up being the best bits.

You don't have to optimise this time. You don't have to turn it into some perfect version of productivity or self-improvement. Just be in it. Let it be messy and fun and meaningful in its own way.

I won't lie - I'm really going to miss you. Having you nearby has been one of the quiet joys of my life. But I'm also so glad you're stepping into all of this. You deserve every part of what's coming.

Go live your life. I'll be right here, proud of you, always.
