I wanted to write this down so you would always have a piece of my heart with you.

I still remember the moment you came into the world — and the look of shock on your face. Right from day one, you were alert and aware, taking everything in. It was extraordinary to see. You didn’t arrive quietly; you arrived present.

Not long after you were born, your mum was taken away for medical care, and suddenly it was just you and me. I remember holding you and feeling amazed that you were finally here — really here — with me. After all the waiting and wondering, there you were in my arms.

I won’t pretend I wasn’t a little scared. I was. But we were surrounded by such wonderful support, and somehow everything settled into place. It all worked out, just as it needed to.

I spent hours watching you sleep, terrified of waking you but unable to look away. You were so small, yet your presence filled every corner of my world.

Life moves fast, and moments blur together, but this one never has. I hope you carry these stories with you as you make your own way through life — knowing that from your very first day, you were deeply loved.
