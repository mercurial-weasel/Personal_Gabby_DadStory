If I had to distill everything I’ve learned into a few simple things for you, it would be this.

People matter more than anything else. Careers change. Plans fall apart. Life takes unexpected turns. But the people you walk alongside — your friends, your family, the ones who really show up — they’re what make life meaningful. Choose them well, and be someone worth choosing.

Look after your integrity. It’s the one thing nobody can take from you unless you give it away. Be kind, be honest, and take responsibility for your choices — especially when it’s uncomfortable. That’s how you build a life you can stand behind.

Be persistent, even when things feel slow or hard or uncertain. And find the courage to keep moving forward when you don’t yet know how everything will work out. Some of the most important progress you’ll ever make will happen quietly, one small step at a time.

Life will hurt sometimes. People will disappoint you. There will be moments when things feel heavy or dark. But I promise you this — those seasons don’t last forever. If you keep going, if you stay open, the light always comes back. It may look different than you expected, but it comes.

And don’t carry bitterness. Holding onto resentment only weighs you down. Forgiveness isn’t about excusing what happened — it’s about freeing yourself so you can keep moving forward.

I don’t know exactly what your future will look like. But I know you already have everything you need to build a good life: your heart, your strength, your ability to connect with people, and your quiet determination.

These words aren’t instructions. They’re just pieces of me — here for you whenever you need them.

I am so proud to be your Dad, Gabby. Watching you grow into yourself has been one of the greatest privileges of my life. Always.
