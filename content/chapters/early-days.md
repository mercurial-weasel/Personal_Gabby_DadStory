DAD, what kind of house did you grow up in and what was the old neighborhood like?
I moved to a big sandstone house in a suburb called Royston Park when I was about 10.
Our house had a huge back yard abd a great bit fig tree in that used which I used to love to club.
We lived in that house until I was about 16 and while we were there Mum and Dad put a swimming pool in and a half-court (tennis).
The swimming pool was great. We used to have lots of pool parties and BBQs where friends would come over and the kids would just hang about and get up to mischief.
Later we put a full size tennis court in and Dad would have friends over every Wednesday to play.
Us kids used to have friends over and in summer we lived outside
In the lounge room we had a big fireplace and winters were spent inside goofing around

DAD, when you were a kid what was your favorite holiday and how did you family celebrate it?
Christmas. We would have the whole family to our house for the daya, and we would have a table piled high with delicisous food. My Uncle Roy would dress up as Santa claus (we never knew it was him) and we’d all get lots of presents. Christas was spent running around haaving fun and the kids would have their own table to sit at – with lots of chips and drinks.
In the lead up to Christmas we’d have all Mum and Dad’s friends to the house and there would be heaps of kids running around having fun.
I remember having a soda fight with bottles of creaming soda. We got into trouble for that one!!
After the parties we’d head down to Encounter Bay and stay in a house near the beach.
As we got older we were allowed to bring a friend down with us.
We’d play cards, board games, fish, go to the beach, read books and generally just have lots of fun.

DAD, which were your favorite pets, and what made them special?
My dog Benji.
I got him when I was six.
He was a lovely golden retriever who just wanted to be with me.
He got a little chubby in his later years and I used to get him to tow me on a skateboard so he could get a good run.
He loved food and attention – probably in that order.

Later on we got a Doberman after our house was robbed.
The first dog was Cassie.
She was crazy. She used to run around and around the front yard and wore a track in the grass.
Cassie got out one day and was hit by a car – I think she was only 2 or 3. Very sad.
We bought another Doberman called Cleo who was a really nice dog – she was a sooky dog who always wanted to be with people.

DAD, who were your best friends from childhood, and what were they like?
My first best friend was Geoff.
Geoff was a great big softie, and we did everything together. For a while I practically lived at his house. He had this huge, joyful energy — a bit hyper — and when he first came to stay with us at our beach house one summer, his parents warned mine not to give me red cordial because he would completely lose it.
He did anyway.
He got so excited he started eating chicken bones and tissues. Don’t ask me why. Kids are strange. I was a little strange myself :)

DAD, what were your favorite subjects in school, and why?
I loved maths and science and geography. I also really enjoyed biology.
Maths and science came easily to me and I enjoyed the logic of it all. Maths is all about the manipulation of symbols and working in the abstract and I have always enjoyed doing this and been good at doing it.
Science is just inherently cool. There are so many wonderful things about the world and science tells you about them and lets you re-discover the secrets of how things work.

DAD, did you ever win an award you were proud of, and what was it in honor of?
I did win a couple of awards when I was younger.
One was a maths award for coming in the top 1% of the state. It was this brutally hard multiple-choice exam where getting a question wrong actually gave you negative marks.
I also won the 800-metre race for my year in Years 6, 7, and 8, and even made it to the state finals.
Looking back, that feels pretty symbolic. I’m really not built for quick sprints or instant wins. Persistence — that’s my bag ;)

DAD, what was the worst trouble you got into when you were younger?
One time when I was younger, we had a whole lot of people over for Christmas. I had recently discovered that if you shake a bottle and then open it, it turns into a fountain.
Naturally, I had to demonstrate this to a friend.
Unfortunately, I picked a bottle of red creaming soda. The moment I took the lid off, it exploded. A bright red fountain shot up and covered the ceiling. Just absolutely everywhere.
Right on cue, Mum walked in.
She was greeted by red creaming soda dripping from the ceiling and two little boys laughing hysterically.
The laughing stopped pretty quickly.
