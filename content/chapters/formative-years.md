DAD, who was your favorite teacher, and why?
My favourite teacher was Mr Warne.
He had the best moustache, a cool deep voice, and this very laid-back way about him that made everyone feel comfortable. Mr Warne taught science and was also my form teacher one year. He was approachable in a way that made you feel safe asking questions or being a bit unsure about things.
What I liked most about him was that he made learning feel relaxed, and people feel accepted. He didn’t embarrass kids. He gave you space to be human.

DAD, did you play a sport, and what did you like best about it?
I played a lot of tennis growing up and was pretty good at it. I found there were times I’d be really, really good, and other times I was really not good, and I could never tell which it would be.
The thing I loved most about tennis was how social it was. You'd have your match, and then you'd have a lot of time in between matches to hang out and talk.
I wanted to be a professional tennis player at one point, but I wasn't talented enough. I still enjoy watching tennis now because of how much I played growing up.

DAD, what rules did your parents have, and which ones drove you crazy?
The funny thing about the rules in my house growing up is that most of them were never really spoken out loud — they were just sort of… there.
You were expected to somehow know what was okay and what wasn’t, even when it changed from day to day. That drove me crazy. I like clarity. I like knowing where the lines are. Growing up, the lines were really blurry.
What I learned from all of this is how important fairness and clarity really are. So if there’s one thing I hoped for you, it’s that you would always know the rules — and why they exist.
