Growing up in that old Victorian house was like living inside a history book. I remember the way the stairs creaked—I eventually learned exactly where to step to sneak down for a midnight snack without waking your grandma. 

The backyard had a giant oak tree where I built my first "fort," which was really just three pieces of plywood and a prayer. It was there I learned that a little imagination could turn a suburban yard into a deep jungle or a lunar base.
