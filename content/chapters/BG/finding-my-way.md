DAD, who taught you to drive, and what was your first car?
My Mum taught me to drive (she was a terrible teacher haha), and my first car experience was a Corolla which was a super reliable car – the most god awful mustard yellow too.
So then in the early 1990s I bought a Mini 850. My friends and I did it up together, pulling the whole car, including the engine, to pieces to learn how it worked. We stripped, painted, and rebuilt the entire Mini.
We sold it for some money—not a lot, because the paint job was bloody awful, but we made enough to recover costs and learn how engines worked.

DAD, what are one or two things you did that you didn’t tell your parents about?
When I was probably about 18 or 19 I borrowed the family car which was a great big Volvo to go camping with.
We were camping at my friend’s block on the beach. They had rabbits on the block and one day we decided to drive around and came across some rabbits. I was a bit silly because I decided to chase the rabbits in the car.
Man, those bunnies can really move. We got to about 60 km/hr on pretty bumpy ground and I hit a huge hole in the sand. The car slammed to a stop. I never told my parents but they thought the mechanic had damaged the car.

DAD, what were your first few jobs? What did you do, and do you remember how much you earned?
My very first job was delivering pizzas. I drove an old Corolla car and was paid $2.80 per pizza delivered. The best part was that if you worked for two hours, you got free pizza. On a good day, I could deliver about five or six pizzas in an hour, making around $12 an hour, which was pretty good money at the time.

DAD, what music did you grow up listening to?
I really only “discovered” music when I was about 19 or so.
When I first started to get into music I started with a lot of older music first – The Beatles, Elton John, Simon and Garfunkel.
Later I began really getting into Dire Straits & U2, and I remember really loving Sinead O’Connor’s Nothing Compares to You and Bon Jovi.
If you get the chance check out Timmy & the Crickets or Captain Beaky & his Band – that's the stuff we had in the car when I was little!

DAD, how did you meet Mom?
Your Mum was introduced to me by a friend of mine, Lawrence (aka Rocket Boy) who was in the SES with me. Lawrence lived in a share house in Collingwood and they had a girl from NZ move into the house.
I first met Linda at their shared house and we spent a lot of time going through all of Linda’s photography books.
After this I asked your Mum out on a date. It was super cold and your Mum had a fur lined jacket that I ended up wearing – and me doing this was when your Mum decided that she really liked me.

DAD, how did you spend your free time before you had kids?
I spent a lot of my free time outdoors. I did heaps of long-distance hikes — driving out to the Flinders Ranges and different bush walks around South Australia.
When I was younger, I also loved games. I played things like D&D, and I was an avid reader.
Then, as I got older, there was a phase of throwing some pretty epic parties. One time we put beer in the bathtub and stuck tape on the floor saying “BEER.” When we pulled the tape up, it still said “BEER” in clean letters on a muddy carpet right before Mum visited. Oops.
