DAD, what’s your favorite memory of your dad? Your mom?
When I think about my dad, I always remember him at the snow. This serious man put on a snow suit and slid down the mountain on his belly like a penguin, laughing.
From him, I learned that you can be serious and still have fun.
My favourite memory of my mum was at the Murray River. My uncle Gary picked her up and threw her in. She was shocked — then just accepted it. From her, I learned that persistence matters. You keep going, even when something unexpected happens.

DAD, what’s the best thing your dad and/or mom taught you?
I think the best thing my Dad taught me was perseverance. Somehow I learnt from Dad never to give up. He was a very gentle man but very tenacious. Seeing my Dad dying while still working for the family taught me a lot about life. He died at peace with himself, and I’m still learning from his life.

DAD, what traits do you have that your parents also had?
I’m most like my Dad’s side. He was hard working, clever but loved to play jokes and pranks. Dad was also quite shy and anxious and I’m a bit like this too.
Mum influenced my emotional makeup to an unusual degree. I’ve tried hard to get her approval over the years, a trait she got from her family, but I am now breaking that cycle. Be you Gabby. I will always be proud of you.

DAD, what was your toughest lesson in life?
My toughest lesson has been to not let go of the dreams and passions that are in me. I have spent too many years trying to do what I thought would make other people happy.
Slowly, slowly I have been able to come back to me and hear what I want. Listen to your heart! I have learnt that all things can be overcome – but only with love and support.

DAD, what is the best advice you ever received, and from whom?
The advice I received during one of my most darkest times was to surrender. Accept reality.
You can’t change reality, but you can change yourself. Surrender. Feel Love.

DAD, what are some ways—good and bad—the world has changed since you were a kid?
The massive change I saw was the arrival of the internet and mobile phones. When I was a kid, if you broke down while driving, you had to walk to a landline phone to get help. People used to help each other out if you saw someone broken down. Instant communication is a massive improvement, even if it has downsides.
