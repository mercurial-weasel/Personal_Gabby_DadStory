DAD, what do you remember about the birth of your children?
When you were born, Gabby, the doctor lifted you up and you looked around with the brightest blue eyes I had ever seen—truly like the Fremen from Dune. Your expression seemed to say, “What just happened, and who are all of you?”
With Samantha, the memory is different. What I remember most is a single moment of the most beautiful stillness and peace I have ever felt. It felt like we slowed down the craziness of the world to simply say goodbye with love.

DAD, what was it like to become a father?
It was wonderful. Truly my life’s greatest blessing.
I was struck by a deep and fierce love for you. I will always love you intensely, deeply and fully. It has been a privilege to watch you grow and to see you become the lovely person you are.
As a father I always hoped I could really help you with life’s challenges, but what I most want is to spend time with you.

DAD, what is one of your favorite memories of being a dad?
Reading books together in bed is one of my favourite memories – it’s such a lovely time when we get to muck around – read books, make “smoothies”, have tickle wars.
I think this trip to Bornholm will become a memory I cherish also. To be on holiday as a family and do all the things we have done together has been so much fun. Making crepes, listening to music, playing games — it’s all been lovely.
