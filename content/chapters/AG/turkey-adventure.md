Gabby, they say the best adventures are the ones you don't perfectly plan, but I think we took that a bit too literally for our trip to Turkey. 

I'll be honest—we really should have spent more time on the details. I was so focused on the big picture that the small things, like check-in times and transfer routes, almost became our undoing before we even left the ground.

What I remember most vividly is the sprint through the terminal. The "Final Call" for Istanbul was flashing in red, and there we were, suitcases clattering behind us, lungs burning, genuinely thinking we were going to be watching our plane depart from the lounge window. We made it with literally seconds to spare—the kind of luck you only get once in a lifetime.

But now that we're here, all that frantic energy has melted away.

content: Tomorrow is the big one—the hot air balloon ride over Cappadocia. We've talked about this for years. Imagine hundreds of colorful balloons rising with the sun over the "fairy chimneys" and ancient valleys. It's supposed to be one of the most silent, surreal experiences on earth. I promise I won't drop the camera!

content: We've already explored the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque, but the Grand Bazaar was something else. The smells of spices, the endless tea, and the sheer history of Istanbul is overwhelming in the best way. Next on the list is the cotton castles of Pamukkale and the ruins of Ephesus. Every corner of this country feels like a secret waiting to be told.
